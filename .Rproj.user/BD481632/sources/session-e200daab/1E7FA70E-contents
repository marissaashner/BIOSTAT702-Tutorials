## **Expected Background:** 

BIOSTAT701 and BIOSTAT704 or similar. Experience with programming in R.

## **Course Objectives:** 

This is a course in applied survival analysis. By the end of the course, you will be able to: 

-   have a deep working knowledge of Kaplan Meier curves to estimate survival distributions and the standard Cox proportional hazards model to model the effects of explanatory variables on time to event outcomes
-   perform standard survival analyses in a way that supports team science 
-   effectively interpret and explain survival analysis results to others 
-   understand enough about alternative survival analysis techniques to recognize their necessity for a given problem and to contribute a head start toward using these alternatives when needed

The class goals around survival analysis will have been accomplished if you (1) develop deep working knowledge of the standard Cox model; (2) can perform standard analyses using that model in a way that supports team science (e.g., by contributing to manuscripts and other presentations); (3) can effectively explain your results to others; and (4) can identify when you should consider something other than this standard model, and understand enough about the alternatives as to constitute a head start toward learning these alternatives as needed.    

## **Textbook(s):**

No textbooks are required for this course. However, the textbook that will be primarily used as a resource is:

-   Moore, D. F. (2016). *Applied Survival Analysis Using R*. Springer International Publishing.

This textbook is available as a PDF on the course Canvas site, as well as another more theoretical textbook for those interested: 

-    Klein, J. P., & Moeschberger, M. L. (2003). *Survival Analysis: Techniques for Censored and Truncated Data (2nd ed.).* Springer.

## **Software:**

The R programming language will be the major platform for statistical computing in this course. You may use SAS instead of R for completion of assignments, but the responsibility will be on you to learn the appropriate methods in SAS (although I will provide some SAS resources throughout). 

## **Course Format:**

For most of the class periods, we will start with a pre-reading quiz and discussion, followed by a (hopefully interactive) lecture. There will be time for questions throughout and after the lecture. If there is time, the end of class can be used to get started on module exercises or homework assignments. 

## **Slido:**

slido is a website I will be using for interactive polling and Q&A during class. You can access our slido using this [link](https://app.sli.do/event/mHVBzr46eCykb6fNrKWRHe), or by joining at [slido.com](https://www.slido.com) with the code **7132024**. There is also a QR code I will show on the screen when we are using it.

The objective of using slido during class is to allow you to anonymously ask and answer questions since that can, at times, be an easier way to engage than speaking out loud. Although speaking out loud is also encouraged :) 

## **Grading:**

*Pre-reading Quizzes/Attendance: 10\% (20 total)*

We have 25 total days of class, and 20 of these will have pre-reading quizzes. I will ask you to read an article before class, and you will take a short quiz at the beginning of class (on Canvas, open 3:15-3:45 PM) to answer 3 short questions relating to the article. The questions are in the slides on Canvas so you can even find them beforehand. There is a fourth question on the quiz asking for a secret word, which I will give you during class. This is the only question on the quiz that will be graded for correctness, meaning you must attend class to get the quiz points. The lowest 10 quiz scores will be dropped (AKA: I am asking you to show up to 10/25 classes for 10\% of your grade). 

The objective of the pre-reading quizzes is (1) to encourage you to attend some classes in person and (2) to have you gain experience reading, comprehending, and critquing literature surrounding survival analysis.

*Module Exercises: 20\% (12 total)* 

Module exercises are listed at the end of 12 of the 20 modules and are attended to be shorter, simpler assignments to allow you to practice applying and solidifying the concepts learned in the course. You may collaborate with each other on these exercises but your final product must be your own. Please include any code used on all module exercises. Two module exercises will be due at one time, on Wednesdays via Canvas by 11:59 PM. See the course schedule for more details. 

The objective of the module exercises is to give you hands on experience with the concepts and code I demonstrate in class. 

\vspace{0.5cm}

*Homework Assignments: 15\% each (3 total)*

Homework assignments will be assigned after every 6 modules. These assignments are more open-ended than the module exercises; they provide you with a dataset and a couple research questions, and you must deliver a report that answers the research questions using the techniques we have learned in class. 

The objective of the homework assignments is to give you experience in making statistical decisions when there is no clear-cut questions or answers, especially in the context of time-to-event related research questions.

*Final Exam: 25\%*
